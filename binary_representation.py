"""Let the user enter a positive int number (including 0)
(ensure that a positive value (>=0) has been entered!)
Store the base 2 in a variable called new_baseâ€º
Compute the representation of the number in base new_base (see slide 110) and print the new representation.
The binary digits should be in the correct order!
What happens if you change new_base to another value, e.g.
new_base = 7 or
new_base = 1 or
new_base = 0 ?
Answer this question in the comment field.
Hinweis:
In this task, you exercise:

binary representation of unsigned numbers
